            We are the FIRST CNFT project to provide a RUG POOL for rugpull
            victims.We will allocate 50% of our royalties each quarter from the
            first OG collection of 3333 Apocalypticats to help fight the war on
            rugs.
          </p>
          <p>It would be known as the RUG POOL .</p>
          <p>Here is what the process would look like.</p>
          <p data-aos="zoom-in-left">
            At the end of each quarter, all apolypticats will discuss/vote as a
            community and decide on the TOP 3 rugs in the CNFT space for that
            quarter.

        </div>
        <p data-aos="zoom-in-left" className="size pt-md-3 m-0">
          Once the decision has been made, we would take a snapshot of all
          wallets holding Apocalypticats NFTs+ any of the top 3 Rugs , count and
          immediately add them to the beneficiaries of the RUG POOL airdrop.
          This would also be done at the end of that quarter.
