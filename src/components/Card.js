            Once upon a blockchain many many epochs from now in an ecosystem
            many blockchains away from the Cardano universe, there was a large
            asteroid that crashed into the Apocalypticats planet decimating
            Almost all life, covering the planet with thick fog ,complete
            silence, and a presence of death and blood
          </p>
          <h1 className="text-start my-3 my-md-1">BEFORE IMPACT : </h1>
          <p>
            The Apocalypticat king had no choice but to take 4444 apocalypticats
            and lead them underground into the bunker to wait out the blast…………{" "}

          After impact the king tasked 3333 elite Apocalypticat warriors to
          escape the destroyed planet, To find a way to save the rest in the
          bunker , the remaining 1111 were tasked to stay and hold down the
          bunker….

            It is unknown if the 1111 are still alive and how the 3333
            Apocalypticats escaped the planet and why they chose to go back in
            time into the cardano ecosystem, All we know forsure is that they
            are set out to save there kin and their homeland,
