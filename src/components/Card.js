            Once upon a blockchain, many many epochs from now.
            <br /> In an ecosystem, a million blockchains away from the Cardano
            universe, there was a bountiful planet full of intelligent life. The
            inhabitants Are now known as the Apocalypticats. A once jolly and
            peaceful colony of cats always just hanging out in the bunker,
            helping each other out. Unfortunately, their lives were about to be
            changed forever.
          </p>
          <p>
            One calm starry night, while most of the cats were asleep, a large
            asteroid crashed into the Apocalypticats planet. It never showed up
            on their radar. Not till it was too late, The Apocalypticat king had
            no choice but to take 4444 apocalypticats and lead them underground
            into the bunker to wait out the hail of fire.

          Covered in a thick fog, complete silence, and a presence of death and
